One thing Nassim Taleb keeps repeating on is the importance of understanding the properties of a variable before everything else. I kinda agree. I think we too often dwelve into complicated statistics while making too many wrong assumptions.

I tried to think if I could implement this advice from Taleb into football modeling. Now I'm still not sure about what I've done but still thought I should give it a shoot. I know when it comes to sports modeling, the more data - the better. Anyway I wanted to see if maybe it's could be the other way around. Maybe, this data just makes the models more certain with no apparent reason.

Football is a low scoring game and very random. It is a very complex system hence, it is really hard to predict. I was thinking what if I try to model the randomness of some teams.
