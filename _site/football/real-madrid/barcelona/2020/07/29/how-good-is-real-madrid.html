    <p>This season (2019-20) started well for Barcelona and not so well for Real Madrid. The corona forces the league to a halt at March 20 and the league returned only in June (or July?). From there things took a left turn for Barcelona. They had their way paved for another championship in the laliga yet somehow managed to mess things up. Real turned out to be really great after the corona break, winning most of their games and not one single loss.</p>

<p>After they were crowned champions I read some crtics saying they (Real Madrid) were the worst performing champions of the laliga. I decided to check it out and see how are they compared to previous years champions. Below I have added a plot where x-axis is the number of goals for and the y-axis is goals against and total points for the season inside brackets. As you can see, they weren’t spectacular in attack but they were very good defensively.</p>

<p>Code for the plot available <a href="/https://github.com/bm1125/football-analysis/blob/master/laliga_champions.py">here</a></p>

<p>I’ve used the aggregated stats from whoscored of Barcelona and Real madrid.</p>

<p>Defensively:</p>
