        <div class="post"><p>I have always been fascinated with sports betting and professional bettors. I have tried several times in the past to do it professionally, either in quantitative or qualitative ways. I guess it is much harder nowadays to find an edge with quantitative models versus qualitative assessment. The literature I read stated that the market is very efficient for popular sports leagues. In the book soccermatics, <a href="https://twitter.com/soccermatics/">David Sumpter</a> did find that draw odds in matches of equivalent teams were underpriced. That edge was quickly exploited by others and bettors, and it faded. There was one guest in the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bet-the-process/id1291010585">bet the process</a> that claimed that are much more money to be made in qualitative ways.</p>

I actually did this quite a while ago. I just wanted to make more concise and clean notebook so I started afresh. This time I used fixtures data from football-data.co.uk (instead of football-api.org last time). I took the FIFA team rankings (defense, midfield, attack and overall) of each team in the english permier league for the seasons 17-20.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>I think the best way to explain the idea behind the zero inflated poisson is with an example. As the name suggests, it is a model in which the observed data suggests that an observations with zero counts is more likeliy than suggested by a regular poisson model.
Lets say I want to model the amount of a goals a football player scores in a match. For the sake of simplicity I’m going to assume that the player is either playing all of the match or isn’t playing at all. The data will probably suggests higher count of zero occurences as sometimes the player will not be playing due to various reasons. So what I need to model is two different processes. One is the probability of a player playing in some match $\ k $, the other is the rate (poisson process) of events.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>The twelve chapter of Statistical Rethinking by Richard Mclearth is about multilevel (or hierarchical) model. The multilevel models are sort of a compromise between independent and dependent clusters. I think one of the advantages of such model is that it allows me to say that I’m not really sure about the relationship between clusters. And it may be that one cluster has some infromative value on another cluster. In my case each cluster represent a team. I will try and make a multilevel model to predict english premier leauge games.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>This season (2019-20) started well for Barcelona and not so well for Real Madrid. The corona forces the league to a halt at March 20 and the league returned only in June (or July?). From there things took a left turn for Barcelona. They had their way paved for another championship in the laliga yet somehow managed to mess things up. Real turned out to be really great after the corona break, winning most of their games and not one single loss.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>Since I get confused a lot when trying to use the gamma function in R and I tend to forget its properties so I wrote this simple reminder. The Gamma distribution is used to predict what is the probability of <em>k-th</em> events to occur in a specific time interval. It’s important to remember, as you will mostly use only the cdf fucntion (As with most continiuous functions), so the question it is answering is, given some rate of events and some events count, what is the probability of observing this amount of events in chosen <strong>T</strong> time?</p>
