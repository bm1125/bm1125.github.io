        <div class="post"><p>Previously I had worked on two different models trying to predict football 1X2 results. In the first model, the idea behind it was that maybe xG could provide extra signal and I found that it is easier to predict xG than goals. I had many iterations over, starting out with just a glm that also takes in xG prediction, then moved to predict directly goals difference using OLS instead of goals scoring, later on i picked multinomial logistic model when I understood that maybe SSE is not the right choice for loss function of a model and then due to model going crazy often, applied regularization (ridge regression). The other model was simpler, an ELO model where the actual score for each match was computed using 0,1,3 instead of 0,0.5,1 and for the expected score I used 1X2 closing line instead of the model predictions, \(\ 1/odds_{win} * 3 + 1/odds_{draw} * 1\). I made every mistake possible, worked a lot with gpt and gemini, discovered that both made up a lot of numbers when I asked them to run backtest. I think my most important take from this endeavor is that overall model accuracy matter less than finding true signal.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>I came across this tweet of Ernest Chan where he advised to use deming regression instead of OLS to find the best regression line when measuring cointegration. OLS assumes no noise for the predictor and only for the predicted variable. So it finds the regression line that reduce the distances as measured vertically. Deming regression allows for noise of both the predictor and the predicted variable with extra parameter, \(\delta\). \(\delta\) is the ratio of the standard deviations of variables noise. if \(y^*_i, x^*_i\) are the “true” values:</p>

Palomar from Hong Kong university. To reiterate from the paper, he suggests testing for cointegration instead of testing for assets returns correlation. While correlation characterizes short term co-movement, cointegration refers  to the long term co-movement. I think, if I understand correctly then the idea behind cointegration is to check for the difference between noramlized prices of assets and see if the difference is stationary. If it is then one can just regress the price of asset 1 over the price of asset 2 (with OLS) since they will converge at some point.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>I have always been fascinated with sports betting and professional bettors. I have tried several times in the past to do it professionally, either in quantitative or qualitative ways. I guess it is much harder nowadays to find an edge with quantitative models versus qualitative assessment. The literature I read stated that the market is very efficient for popular sports leagues. In the book soccermatics, <a href="https://twitter.com/soccermatics/">David Sumpter</a> did find that draw odds in matches of equivalent teams were underpriced. That edge was quickly exploited by others and bettors, and it faded. There was one guest in the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bet-the-process/id1291010585">bet the process</a> that claimed that are much more money to be made in qualitative ways.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>I think the best way to explain the idea behind the zero inflated poisson is with an example. As the name suggests, it is a model in which the observed data suggests that an observations with zero counts is more likeliy than suggested by a regular poisson model.
Lets say I want to model the amount of a goals a football player scores in a match. For the sake of simplicity I’m going to assume that the player is either playing all of the match or isn’t playing at all. The data will probably suggests higher count of zero occurences as sometimes the player will not be playing due to various reasons. So what I need to model is two different processes. One is the probability of a player playing in some match $\ k $, the other is the rate (poisson process) of events.</p>

        <div class="post"><p>The twelve chapter of Statistical Rethinking by Richard Mclearth is about multilevel (or hierarchical) model. The multilevel models are sort of a compromise between independent and dependent clusters. I think one of the advantages of such model is that it allows me to say that I’m not really sure about the relationship between clusters. And it may be that one cluster has some infromative value on another cluster. In my case each cluster represent a team. I will try and make a multilevel model to predict english premier leauge games.</p>

It’s important to remember, as you will mostly use only the cdf fucntion (As with most continiuous functions), so the question it is answering is, given some rate of events and some events count, what is the probability of observing this amount of events in chosen <strong>T</strong> time?</p>
